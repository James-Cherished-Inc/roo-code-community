- In the Table View and Smart View pages, gracefully incoroporate a multi-selection beautiful dropdown menu allowing to choose wich families to load in the current page.
In the menu, there will be by default the Default family (containing all the default modes), and an option to import a family from a custom mode json. I think technically, what would work best is to store each family in separate json files? And on export, merge all families except the Default family?
