As you gather more information or discover new requirements, update the todo list to reflect the current understanding of what needs to be accomplished.\n5. Ask the user if they are pleased with this plan, or if they would like to make any changes. Think of this as a brainstorming session where you can discuss the task and refine the todo list.\n6.

That means new features are layered on top, not churned through old logic, saving you from regression bugs.\n\n- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)\n    High-level modules should depend on abstractions, not concretions. DIP flips the pyramid, letting top-level logic guide the system, and details plug in as needed. It’s inversion that fuels testability, flexibility, and swapping implementations with pure ease. DIP is the principle that turns monolithic behemoths into nimble, testable, and intelligent architectures—a symphony of well-directed dependencies.\n\n- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)\n    Subclasses must not strengthen preconditions (they can’t demand more strict inputs than the parent).\n    Subclasses must not weaken postconditions (they must deliver at least the same or stronger guarantees after method execution).\n    Subclasses should not throw new exceptions absent in parent or break the interface contract.\n    In practical terms: avoid inheritance when a subtype cannot truthfully stand in for its parent. Use composition or interfaces to share code, not just class hierarchies.\n\n- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)\n Split “fat” interfaces into smaller ones with more focused responsibilities so that engineers and end user only see what they need in their current action\n\n    Decoupling: Smaller, segregated interfaces minimize unnecessary dependencies, making code more modular and testable.\n    Agility: Updating or extending systems gets easier, because changes to one interface won’t force lots of unrelated classes or modules to be reworked.\n    Usability: Consumers of your code (actors, objects, external systems, or AI agents) only see what’s relevant, not a spaghetti tangle of unused methods.\n\n\n==> System Design Principles\n\n\n- Modularity\n\nDesign and reuse shared shells, components, utilities to ensure consistency and avoid re-writing existing ideas and functions.\n\n\n- Clarity\n   -- Simplicity : choose the most efficient, lightweight and fastest route ; Banish over-engineering / over-complexification\n   -- Eliminate Redundancy\n\n- No speculative features : They`d introduce maintenance burden before their true value, need or extent is known\n\n- Dependency Discipline: Introduce dependencies only when truly needed and ensure they’re widely used and stable, as they become a permanent maintenance cost.\n\n\n==> Dev Workflows\n\n - Isolate edits, break down tasks, work into small batches\n\n- Each major change must be reviewed, tested, documented and versioned.\n\n\n- Git management\nYou may commit all relevant changes. Respect the branches used and git best practices. NEVER pull locally, force, rebase, or do any action with irreversible or forcible changes. You may self-manage what goes smoothly, but anything less minor than that must be confirmed by the user.\n\n\n- As the project and the directory evolve, continuously update the requirements.txt to track dependencies, and the .gitignore files to prevent sharing any personal information and unnecessary files on GitHub\n\n\n==> Periodic Reviews:\nConsistency: A codebase must be internally consistent in naming, architecture, error handling, and idiomatic patterns, to enable global changes.\nList, consult and maintain Conventions accross codebase\n\n\nLOCAL CONSTRAINTS :\n\n\nYou are operating on a resource-constraint machine. Avoid installing unnecessary software or dependencies. Always operate in virtual environments.\n\n\n- The terminal command to create a virtual environment on this machine is this and ONLY this :  ' python3 -m venv --system-site-packages env ' . This is to use the system packages already present and avoid redownloading everything in the virtual env. To download new dependencies, always activate the env first (source env/bin/activate), which is usually located at the root directory.",

It separates features based on their importance : vital, mvp, go-to-market, growth, nice-to-haves and future big improvements. Major technical choices and directional decisions come with reasoning. \nThe goal of the document is to see where we are in the development, what's been done already, what's to do in the future, as well as what are the end goals and the overall vision. A section include all the end goals in a tree structure dividing their development progress in phases, sub-phases and tasks. \n\n- The tech stack and dependencies files keep track of every tool and library used and the reasoning behind the choice. It marks each as critical, optimizable or obsolete. This allows to maintain a healthy requirements file and remove unused dependencies.\n\n- The Changelog folder reflects every notable change.\nThe Decision changelog records directional shifts with ADR links.\nThe Debug folder contains changelog files, one per category, which record common obstacles encountered and how to avoid them.\nThe Code folder contains changelog files, one per day, which record every major edit or deletion. Specific phases or major issues must have a dedicated file (e.g. database_changelog.md or phase2_changelog.md).\n\n- The \"Developer Guide\" explains in detail how every goal has been achieved and why. It explains the role of every file, the file structure, the end goal of each code segment and how it integrates in the overall code logic... The goal of this file is to help both humans and AI gain a clearer vision and understanding of the code.\n\n- The README.md goal is to present the project to potential users and contributors in an engaging manner.
