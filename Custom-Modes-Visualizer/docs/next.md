DO NOT TOUCH

- Add Coding Best Practices
- Better explain how to use the technical writer in each mode

- Description and Usage cells in the Table View page should also be multiple line editable fields, not inline editable fields (with only 1 line)
- show redundancies across prompts of different modes + all-modes instructions.
- copy button top right of each prompt cell to copy their content
- to the left of the name field when creating a new mode, on the same line as the name field, add a simple emoji selector (only characters that won't break our database storage, just like current default modes), which will be added before the name in our database, so names are always augmented with nice colored emojis

- Prompt Builder
