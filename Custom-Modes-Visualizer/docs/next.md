DO NOT TOUCH

- when only 1 word is chosen in the Cross-Mode Redundancy Analysis, display in the stats in which modes it has been detected.
- The tips are at the bottom of the Cross-Mode Redundancy Analysis panel. Move them just below the Redundancies panel with the stats etc. Therefore, remove the duplicate single tip that is above the redundancies panel (Tip: Right-click on highlighted words to exclude them or show only their occurrence)

- In Smart View page, double clicking on the prompt to edit it reduce the size of the view, the editable field is too small. Is it possible to have an editable field that displays all the text? Same size as when it is not being edited? thank you
- Allow choosing / creating a family when creating a mode
- In Smart View page, the "press Enter to save" tip is incorrect, since Ctrl+Enter is the keyboard command to save.
