DO NOT TOUCH

- Prompt Builder: add the possibility for users to create their own block (feature) that they can tick or untick when building prompts! Users can create a new feature which has a name and a prompt content (e.g. Always speak like a parrot might be the prompt content for the block named Parrot). Ticking Parrot will include this prompt in the output of the algorithmic prompt builder! Users can rearrange the order of blocks with drag-and-drop to create the prompt of their dream in the order they want!
