# My go-to Crew

#### Check *.roomodes* for the prompts. 
Adding .roomodes at the root of your workspace will enable the custom modes described in the file.
Please note the specific format is required for Roo to read the modes, as of April 2025.

The modifications of the "classic" modes are for my personal needs and tastes. You're free to draw inspiration from them.
You can find them at *custom-classic-modes.md*.

* Technical Writer
* Custom Boomerang Mode
* Research Mode
* Custom Coder
* Custom Ask (mentor)
* Custom Architect
* Custom Debugger

# My Footgun prompting

#### Check *.roo/* for the full system prompt
Adding .roo/ at the root of your workspace will replace the system prompt entirely for each custom mode specified.
Please note that as of April 2025, the custom instructions set in the settings of the Roo extension are added on top of your footgun prompts. Additionally, it is only possible to footgun the system prompt for a specific prompt.

The modifications of the system prompts maintain all the tools instructions but were made for my personal needs and tastes. You're free to draw inspiration from them.
